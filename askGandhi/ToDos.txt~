TODOS:


- User pic upload
- Edit Question
- Search
- Ranking Algorithm


Nitgrits for alpha version:
- Form Styling, crispy not working for login/registration, etc.
- exclude the rank_score field 
- add answer voting
- urlify the entire site
- css issues: override button styling and footer viewport issue

- form error redirect not happening (workign on it)

-- exclude question selection from answers

KNOWN ERRORS:

1. When a logged out user tries to vote then he is redirected to login as expected, but after logging in he gets an error
(In general, there are a couple of problems with the forms that should be looked into)
